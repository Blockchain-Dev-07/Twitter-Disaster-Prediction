# Twitter-Disaster-Prediction

A Bidirectional LSTM model to classify whether a given tweet talks about a real disaster or not. This was my project in "CSC 522: Automated Learning and Data Analysis" course at NC State University.

The data can be found on the Kaggle challenge Data Page here: [Real or Not? Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/nlp-getting-started/data/).

The complete details for the dataset used, the approach along with the results can be found in the [Presentation](Disaster_Prediction_Presentation.pdf) and the [Project Report](Disaster_Prediction_Report.pdf) in the repository.
